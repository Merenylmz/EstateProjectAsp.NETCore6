Hello. In this project, I used postgresql on the backend side and postgresql on the frontend side and nuxt.js on the frontend side. This is a project that I did in my first internship place. If you want to run the program, delete the migration folder on the backend side, if there is no such folder, migrate from the package manager console.
You can run it by saying "npm run dev" directly on the nuxt js side.

If you want to get information about this or another project, you can send an e-mail :)
